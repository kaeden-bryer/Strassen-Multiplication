## About

Strassen's Algorithm is a more efficient algorithm for matrix multiplication as the number of dimensions increases.
Strassen's Algorithm has a runtime of O(n^log2(7)), which is â‰ˆ O(n^2.81), which is asymptotically faster than naive
matrix multiplication which produces a runtime of O(n^3).
